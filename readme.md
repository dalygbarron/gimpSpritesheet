# About
These two plugins allow you to convert horizontal spritesheet images into a
collection of layers in gimp, and convert a collection of layers into a
horizontal stylesheet.

The primary usefulness of this comes from easy insertion and rearrangement of
animation frames within a spritesheet without having to configure a grid of the
correct size and move things around etc.

Also, when you are working with animated gifs in gimp, these are naturally in
the form of a sequence of layers, but sometimes it can actually be useful to
convert these layers into a spritesheet temporarily for the application of
special effects to every layer at once. You will find though that if you apply
the kind of effect that moves data around, that there may be "bleed" between
animation frames when using this technique, but it's kinda cool, and there are
a lot of situations where this will not occur.

# How to install
If you are on linux then these plugins should be put into the folder
`~/.gimp-n.n/plug-ins/`. If you are on windows then I don't know but I would
imagine that it is similar.
